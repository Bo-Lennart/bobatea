## Project Aim

The aim of this project has been to build a full-stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Features such as user authentication, role based accessability to request and manipulate data as well as create a booking system where data is stored, updated and editable with the concept of 'CRUD' for (in this case) a bubble tea restaurant.
